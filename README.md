# Comparison-of-Male-and-Female-Writers

Source of Dataset: 
I pull the data from wikidata: https://query.wikidata.org/. I wanted to know the number of female writers born in the U.S. between 1900 to 2000 so I wrote the code to filter the properties. Without downloading it manually from the browser, I generated the data via the Python script by using 'Requests'.

Method:
I used Python to transform the data into JSON format and counted the number of women writers born in every 20 years from 1900 to 2000. The same method to get the numbers for men writers. The goal is to know the change of proportion of male and female writers in these years. So once printed out the numbers, I put them in an Excel file and used Excel to get the related proportions. I then used Tableau to visualize the comparison and changes.

Conclusion:
The number of men writers born from 1900 to 1980 is larger than the number of female writers born in these years. While from 1980 to 2000, more female writers were born than male writers. The proportion of female writers first decreased then increased from 1900 to 2000. I guess the proportion change has something to do with feminist movements during the years.
